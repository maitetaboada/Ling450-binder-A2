The 2019 season for Tiger Woods begins Thursday!. 
 The 14-time major champion will be teeing it up at Torrey Pines’ South Course in the opening round of the Farmers Insurance Open for his first competitive round of the new year. 
 We will follow his progress, at a venue where he’s won eight times as pro, shot by shot. Follow along below…. 
 Hole No. 7: Par 4, 468 yards. 
 OFF THE TEE (3:28 p.m. ET): Tiger finds the fairway here on the right side. Good stuff. 
 Hole No. 6: Par 5, 544 yards. 
 OFF THE TEE (3:10 p.m. ET): Another long wait here. But Tiger finally is up and blasts driver down the fairway. He should be able to go for this green in two. 
 APPROACH SHOT (3:14 p.m. ET): Tiger takes out a 3-wood for his second shot and he loses this one to the right. It looks like that one ended up in the greenside bunker. 
 AROUND THE GREEN (3:18 p.m. ET): That is not Tiger’s best, as he blasts that out to 15 feet. That one doesn’t even stay on the green. 
 ON THE GREEN (3:22 p.m. ET): Nevermind about that poor shot, he buries the remaining birdie putt to move back to even par. 
 TIGER ON THE DAY: Even through 6 (T-81). 
 Hole No. 5: Par 4, 456 yards. 
 OFF THE TEE (2:48 p.m. ET): Another driver, and this one is missed to the left in the fairway bunker. It’s up and down with the driver so far. 
 APPROACH SHOT (2:52 p.m. ET): That was really nice. This lands long and left of the hole but uses a slope to funnel to within 20 feet of the cup above the hole. 
 ON THE GREEN (2:55 p.m. ET): That runs out of steam and misses low and left by about 6 inches. An easy par though. 
 TIGER ON THE DAY: 1 over through 5 (T-108). 
 Hole No. 4: Par 4, 474 yards. 
 OFF THE TEE (2:30 p.m. ET): Tiger takes driver and this is piped down the middle like the first one. Ideal tee shot. 
 APPROACH SHOT (2:36 p.m. ET): That’s a nice one! This one goes a tiny bit right, but that’s fine, as the ball kicks left off a slope and finishes about 12 feet from the hole for birdie. 
 ON THE GREEN (2:45 p.m. ET): Another miss to the left. Another opportunity missed. Another par. 
 TIGER ON THE DAY: 1 over through 4 (T-111). 
 Hole No. 3: Par 3, 203 yards. 
 OFF THE TEE (2:21 p.m. ET): After a lengthy wait, Tiger drills one in there 10 feet right of the cup. A great birdie look upcoming. 
 ON THE GREEN (2:26 p.m. ET): Nope. This one is missed left and was not a good putt. That’s a par. 
 TIGER ON THE DAY: 1 over through 3 (T-111). 
 Hole No. 2: Par 4, 397 yards. 
 OFF THE TEE (1:56 p.m. ET): This is driver again for TW, but this one is missed a tiny bit right. The ball ends up in the rough, but it does appear to be sitting up a little. So not ideal, but not terrible. 
 APPROACH SHOT (2:01 p.m. ET): That was poor. Tiger loses this one right. It looks that went in the right greenside bunker. Pin is back-right, so this won’t be an easy up and down. 
 AROUND THE GREEN (2:03 p.m. ET): Tiger chips to about 15 feet, that is left for par. 
 ON THE GREEN (2:06 p.m. ET): Another good putt, but another miss slightly right. That’s a bogey. 
 TIGER ON THE DAY: 1 over through 2 (T-104). 
 Hole No. 1: Par 4, 448 yards. 
 OFF THE TEE (1:42 p.m. ET): That is a driver, and it is ROASTED almost dead-center of the fairway. Perfect start for TW. Should be a wedge or short-iron in. 
 APPROACH SHOT (1:48 p.m. ET): This one from 160 yards is OK, but nothing special. The ball finishes about 25 feet right of and slightly below the hole. Should be a simple two-putt par to start. 
 ON THE GREEN (1:52 p.m. ET): Oh man, that was a good putt. But it just slides by the right edge and Tiger has to settle for par. 
 TIGER ON THE DAY: Even through 1 (T-39).
